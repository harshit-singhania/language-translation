# Sequence to Sequence Neural Network for Machine Translation

Sequence to Sequence Neural Network for the task of machine translation from 
English to German. 

The dataset used is the multi30k dataset that can be found [here](https://github.com/multi30k/dataset) and the paper for the Sequence to Sequence model can be found [here](https://arxiv.org/abs/1409.3215)
